Given the head of a singly linked list, the task is to check if the linked list has a loop. A loop means that the last node of the linked list is connected back to a node in the same list.  So if the next of the last node is null. then there is no loop. We need to return true if there is a loop, otherwise false.

The following is an internal representation of every test case (three inputs).
A LinkedList and a pos (1-based index)-Position of the node to which the last node links back if there is a loop. If the linked list does not have any loop, then pos = 0.

Examples:

Input: LinkedList: 1->3->4, pos = 2
Output: true
Explanation: 

See the above list there exists a loop connecting the last node back to the second node.
Input: LinkedList: 1->8->3->4, pos = 0
Output: false
Explanation: 

There is no loop exists.
